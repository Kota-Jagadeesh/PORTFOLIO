                My journey into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science began during my academic pursuits at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The fascination with how machines can learn, adapt, and solve complex problems drew me into this field. This blog post chronicles my experiences, challenges, and milestones as I delved deeper into these transformative technologies.

                The initial exposure came through foundational courses in mathematics and programming, where I learned the importance of linear algebra, statistics, and Python. These skills laid the groundwork for understanding machine learning algorithms and data manipulation techniques. Projects involving datasets from real-world scenarios, such as predicting student performance, ignited my passion further.

            <h2 class="blog-detail-subtitle">Key Learnings</h2>
            <ul class="blog-detail-list">
                <li>Mastering tools like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn for building AI models.</li>
                <li>Exploring neural networks and their applications in image recognition.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with peers on data science competitions, enhancing teamwork skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="blog-detail-paragraph">
                One of the most rewarding experiences was contributing to a university research project that analyzed educational data to improve teaching methodologies. This project not only honed my technical skills but also highlighted the societal impact of AI and data science.
